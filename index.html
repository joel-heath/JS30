    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="01DrumKit">Day 1: Drum Kit</a></h2>
        <p>First day and haven't done JavaScript in a long time so I was basically just following this tutorial character for character, but afterwards I did add MIDI input reading (and remap the terrible key choices).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="02CSS&JSClock">Day 2: CSS & JS Clock</a></h2>
        <p>Again pretty closely following the tutorial, afterwards I added a clock ticking sound, music, and a hover effect on the clock to make it a little more interesting.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="03CSSVars&JS">Day 3: CSS Variables & JS</a></h2>
        <p>Not much going on with todays but it's still quite a cool demonstration of JS interacting with CSS Variables, and I didn't really have anything unique to add to todays.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="04ArrayCardio">Day 4: Array Cardio</a></h2>
        <p>I was able to do one on my own. I got relatively close on some of the others and now I think I'm happy with what I've done, mostly just came down the syntax of JavaScript.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="05ImageGallery/">Day 5: Image Gallery</a></h2>
        <p>Lots of new CSS for todays! I added some fun and exciting sound effects as I thought the JavaScript side was lacking today. The <code>transitionend</code> event came in handy again today.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="06AjaxTypeAhead/">Day 6: Ajax Type Ahead</a></h2>
        <p>Definitely a cool and useful one today, I added the functionality of selecting suggestions, along with hover & click effects. I sorted the list by population because geolocation seems far too daunting.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="07ArrayCardio/">Day 7: Array Cardio</a></h2>
        <p>I managed to do all of these on my own, evidence that this challenge is paying off! (Or that four questions wasn't sufficient.)</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="08HTML5Canvas/">Day 8: HTML5 Canvas</a></h2>
        <p>Today's was a fun one! I followed closely along with the tutorial, then afterwards I added an eraser and resizing of the cursor using the scroll wheel, aswell as sound effects.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="09DevTools/">Day 9: Dev Tools</a></h2>
        <p>A useful set of tools for today, not much else to say about it though. I added music again.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="10Checkboxes/">Day 10: Checkboxes</a></h2>
        <p>I actually managed to do this one on my own, albeit with a couple Google searches along the way. Unfortunately no time for music and sounds today, just a boring old website.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="11VideoPlayer/">Day 11: Video Player</a></h2>
        <p>I was able to complete couple seperate tasks on my own for this one, following along with the structure of the program. I added a fullscreen button after but I'm not sure how to integrate my controls.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="12KonamiCode/">Day 12: Konami Code</a></h2>
        <p>This one was pretty simple so I mostly added styles and audio, but I think it turned out quite nicely. I'm sure there's a better way to do this especially if you have multiple codes though.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="13SlideScroll/">Day 13: Slide Scroll</a></h2>
        <p>This is definitely one of the useful ones for other sites, the implementation here was a bit simple, but nonetheless a cool feature. A custom debounce function had to be made to slow down the scroll events.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="14ReferenceVSCopy/">Day 14: Reference vs Copy</a></h2>
        <p>Today's wasn't much of a project, just based around learning the difference between primitive and reference data types. So to spice it up a little, I added music.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="15LocalStorage/">Day 15: Local Storage</a></h2>
        <p>Useful skills today with local storage and event delegation, I added buttons for clearing, checking and unchecking all, aswell as sound design, as usual.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="16CSSMouseMove/">Day 16: CSS Mouse Move</a></h2>
        <p>Simple and fun one for today, taking inspiration from Day 12 I added a secret code but don't even bother trying to work it out.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="17Sorting/">Day 17: Sorting</a></h2>
        <p>I managed to this one on my own, but only with a <code>trimStart</code> function from stack overflow for trimming sequences of strings. I've now pretty much switched to using Wes' code.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="18ReduceTally/">Day 18: Reduce Timestamps</a></h2>
        <p>This one was pretty simple, sum the timestamps and the method seems quite naive at the moment, I'd like to expand it to support hours as well, and also to <em>reduce</em> the code into a one-liner.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="19WebcamFun/">Day 19: Webcam Fun</a></h2>
        <p>A really fun one for today, I mostly modified the styles aswell as expanding on the effects created. The layout isn't particularily responsive but oh well it's JS30 not CSS30.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="20SpeechRecognition/">Day 20: Speech Recognition</a></h2>
        <p>Not exactly sure how many practical uses this has in the browser environment, other than on Google, but nonetheless a cool one to know. I added a <em>feature</em> replacing 'haha' with 'ðŸ’€'.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="21GeolocationCompass/">Day 21: Geolocation</a></h2>
        <p>I don't really have much to say about today's, it doesn't seem to have much utility and was quite quick to implement.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="22FollowAlongLinks/">Day 22: Hover Follower</a></h2>
        <p>In likeness to yesterday's, this was another simple one. But I think it's a least slightly cooler than yesterdays, it makes for an alright feature on a page. Obviously I added woosh sound effects.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="23SpeechSynthesis/">Day 23: Speech Synthesis</a></h2>
        <p>Completing the other half of the Web Speech API today, an interesting one using the SpeechSynthesis interface. It's a shame there's no support for exporting the audio created through this method.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="24StickyNav/">Day 24: Sticky Nav</a></h2>
        <p>Actually a simple but useful one I could use in a site, not to disrespect the other days but I don't really see myself using a compass in one of my sites.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="25JSEvents/">Day 25: JS Events</a></h2>
        <p>Nothing too exciting today, it was Event Capture, Propagation, Bubbling & Once, I did make some buttons and toggles to display how it works though. Definitely important to know about.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <h2><a href="26FollowDropdown/">Day 26: Hover Follow Dropdown</a></h2>
        <p>Todays was the extension of Day 22 into something that's actually quite cool. I'd certainly like to make some changes if I were to actually use it, fading away & sliding between.</p>
